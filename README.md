# first_portfolio
This assignment we were instructed to make a basic portfolio to show our web-building skills. Three pages; the first being a page just about ourselves. I gave a basic description about myself and my interests, as well as why I have started with programming. The second page is supposed to be a portfolio of examples of our past work, having finished the first project and a recieved some good grades for homework assignments, links to the respective repositories can be found in the form of screenshots of the apps themselves. The third page is a simple contact page, it does not connect to anything at the moment because I do not know how to actually connect it all with the corresponding functions just yet.
