# first_portfolio
This assignment we were instructed to make a basic portfolio to show our web-building skills. Three pages; the first being a page just about ourselves. I gave a basic description about myself and my interests, as well as why I have started with programming. The second page is supposed to be a portfolio of examples of our past work, and seeing as how this is all new to me and I have never before programmed anything, I used pictures of puppies. The third page is a simple contact page, it does not connect to anything at the moment because I do not know how to actually connect it all with the corresponding functions just yet.
