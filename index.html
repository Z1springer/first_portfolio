        Hail and Well met! My name is Zach, I am from Renton, WA. My main interests in the current timeline
        include mostly lore videos relating to some of the well known sci-fi universes. I can roughly answer most
        questions relating to Warhammer 40k and Fantasy, I would consider myself a huge Treky, as well as a huge Star
        Wars fan, Long Live the Sith! The subsequent consumption and memorisation of this information is a near constant
        for me, we all have our hobbies. Though of course when studying facts about fictional universes one would need
        some tunes to go along with the process, and my music taste is a wide and multi-colored thing. I only believe in
        two types of music, those being good and bad, but I am drawn more to music that allows the mind to run free and
        let the spirit feel pure emotion as a result. For when music can make one feel, then it is doing its job right.
        While music and fiction are indeed the constant of my life thus far, recently I have picked up another interest
        that will actually propel me forward, programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        While over my short life I have been spoken to quite a few times about "coding", but in most cases those
        speaking have only ever dabbled in an attempt to make something that would interest them and no other. Seeing it
        only as a means to an end. Never before have I considered it as a possible career option, until I was told that
        it may be the field that I can thrive in by a neuropsychologist. So as a result I have begun a boot-camp that
        while challenging in the extreme, is the best step to get me moving forward in life, rather than staying in one
        place only imagining and reading about better, more fantastical places.
